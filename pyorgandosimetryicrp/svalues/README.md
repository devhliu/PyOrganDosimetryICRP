# S-Values Directory

This directory contains S-value data files based on OLINDA 2.0 for various radionuclides. Each file is named after the radionuclide (e.g., F18.csv, Ga68.csv) and contains a matrix of S-values (mGy/MBq-s) for source-target organ pairs.

## File Format

Each CSV file contains a matrix where:
- Rows represent target organs
- Columns represent source organs
- Values are S-values in mGy/MBq-s
- First row contains header with organ names
- First column contains target organ names

## Included Radionuclides

1. F-18 (T1/2 = 109.77 min)
2. Ga-68 (T1/2 = 67.71 min)
3. Cu-64 (T1/2 = 12.7 h)
4. Zr-89 (T1/2 = 78.41 h)
5. I-131 (T1/2 = 8.02 d)
6. Lu-177 (T1/2 = 6.65 d)
7. Ac-225 (T1/2 = 10.0 d)
8. Pb-212 (T1/2 = 10.64 h)

## Data Source

S-values are derived from OLINDA/EXM 2.0 and are based on ICRP 89 anatomical models.
